#### Idiom64


This plugin has been used on *[Idiom64](https://gregoirebonnet.bandcamp.com/track/idiom64)* (*Digitaltonal Album, © Grégoire Bonnet, 2018*).

>  Idiom64 is the product of phase vocoder algorithms derived from Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) processing. There is a direct relationship between the sampling rate (used by any audio-digital system) and the result given by these algorithms. This is the treatment of a white noise (a sound containing all frequencies). It can be said that the perceived harmony is directly related to the sampling rate.
